# My Money Manager Frontend

## Overview

"My Money Manager" is a web application designed to empower users with comprehensive control over their finances. The frontend part of this application facilitates users in managing their income, expenses, budgets, and financial analysis through intuitive and interactive interfaces.

## Features

- **Income Management**: Users can add various sources of income, including salary, business earnings, or lottery winnings, categorized by account types such as cash, card, investment, and savings.
- **Expense Tracking**: Users can record their expenses, specifying the account used for the transaction and categorizing expenses into types like bills, shopping, rent, etc.
- **Balance Calculation**: The application calculates and displays the user's current balance based on income and expenses.
- **Transaction History**: Detailed transaction history is available for review.
- **Financial Analysis**: Visual graphs provide insights into income and expenditure patterns over different timeframes, including today, week, month, and year.

## Backend

The backend for this application is hosted at [mm-managerbe.onrender.com/api](https://mm-managerbe.onrender.com/api).
It complements the frontend by providing necessary data processing and storage functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- React.js: For building the user interface components and managing state efficiently.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to communicate with the backend API.
- JavaScript: As the primary programming language for frontend logic.
- HTML: For structuring the content of web pages.
- CSS: For styling and presentation.

## Installation

To run the My Money Manager frontend locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, install dependencies by running the following command:

````bash

```

### Usage

To start the frontend server, execute the following command:

```bash

This will launch the application on your local machine, and you can access it via a web browser.

###  Future Enhancements

In the future, I plan to introduce additional features to enhance user experience and functionality. Some potential features include:

Ability to add planned expenses and compare them with actual expenses.
Integration with external financial services for automatic transaction tracking.
Customizable reporting and export options for financial data analysis.
